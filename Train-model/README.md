# Train 

To be able to train a model is not simple, first we have to see which training methods the model is suitable for such as classfication, regression, detection,... With the problem of determining angles as well as colors, the team has Use 2 types of problems for training to compare its effectiveness

## Classfication

* Integrate Jetson's inference capabilities and communicate with the ABB robot arm.
