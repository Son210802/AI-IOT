# Welcome to Angle Detection Repository

In this repository, we provide comprehensive guidance on how to deploy an AI model for detecting angles and colors in an industrial conveyor system. You will find in this repo the following stuff:

1. **Training the Model**: offering a detailed guide on [`trainning model`](https://github.com/Son210802/AI-IOT/blob/main/Train-model/README.md) effectively to detect angles and colors, with complete documentation available here. 
2. **Deploying the Model**: How to deploy the model using [`ONNX Runtime`](https://github.com/Son210802/AI-IOT/blob/main/Onnx-RUNTIME/README.md) which inferences efficiently across multiple platforms and hardware or  [`TensorRT`](https://github.com/Son210802/AI-IOT/blob/main/yoloV8/README.md) to optimize their model for NVIDIA devices.
3.  **Setting Up Communication**: Ensuring efficient communication between systems, we include a guide on setting up a for data transfer between devices.
